# Carbon Comparison

This is a toy project to learn Flask and explore web development. Technologies used:
- Flask (backend)
- Bootstrap (frontend)
- SQLite (database)

The idea is to provide a multi-way carbon calculator, a bit like an exchange rate calculator for carbon emissions. 

To get a local copy running, run the following in your command line:
```buildoutcfg
python app.py
```
